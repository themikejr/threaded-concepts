# Threaded Concepts

**_Threaded Concepts: An Enhanced Reading Feature_**

Core Idea:
Threaded Concepts is a feature integrated into existing Bible study tools or applications that highlights recurring words, themes, or ideas within a biblical passage, enabling readers to trace concept development throughout the text.

Key Components:

1. Full Text View:

   - Displays the entire passage with visually emphasized recurring words or phrases
   - Users can select different threads to focus on various concepts
   - Visual emphasis could include highlighting, different colors, or font variations

2. Snippet View:
   - Presents a list of text snippets showing all occurrences of the selected concept
   - Each snippet includes some surrounding context for better understanding
   - Snippets are arranged in the order they appear in the passage

Example Application:
Let's apply this feature to James 1, using the LEB translation you provided, focusing on the concept of "testing/trials":

Full Text View (excerpt):

2 Consider it all joy, my brothers, whenever you encounter various **trials**, 3 because you* know that the **testing** of your faith produces endurance. 4 And let endurance have its perfect effect, so that you may be mature and complete, lacking in nothing.
...
12 Blessed is the person who endures **testing**, because when he* is approved he will receive the crown of life that he has promised to those who love him. 13 No one who is being **tempted** should say, "I am being **tempted** by God," for God ⌊cannot be tempted⌋ by evil, and he himself **tempts** no one.

Snippet View:

1. "...whenever you encounter various **trials**," (v.2)
2. "...you\* know that the **testing** of your faith produces endurance." (v.3)
3. "Blessed is the person who endures **testing**, because when he\* is approved..." (v.12)
4. "No one who is being **tempted** should say, 'I am being **tempted** by God,'" (v.13)
5. "...and he himself **tempts** no one." (v.13)

Benefits:

1. Contextual Understanding: Helps readers see how concepts evolve within the passage
2. Linguistic Insights: Reveals connections between related words (e.g., trials, testing, tempted)
3. Flexible Learning: Supports different reading styles through full text and snippet views
4. Enhanced Engagement: Encourages deeper interaction with the text
5. Adaptability: Can be integrated into various Bible study platforms or apps
